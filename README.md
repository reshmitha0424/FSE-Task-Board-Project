#TO DO APP

  The TO-DO app is basically used to create a to-do list for ourselves everyday. Everyone does have a lot of works everyday and each and every work will have some deadline too. There may be a lot of chances that we forget at least one of those tasks. So, this TO-DO app helps us to overcome this problem. In this website, one can mark up their tasks they have on a day.
  The TO-DO app works as follows:
1. Click on "Add Task"
2. The screen displays a pop-up asking the name of the task and the status of the task.
3. The status of the task depicts if the task is done for the day or not. 
4. The completed tasks and the incompleted tasks appear on the screen when we request it to show all the tasks by clicking on "All". We can even request it to show only the completed tasks by clicking on "Completed" and the incompleted tasks by clicking on "Incompleted".
5. The completed tasks are shown as ruled out. 
6. Even after saving a task, it has delete and edit options to delete or edit respectively a particular task.
  The TO-DO app can be used by everyone. It is very simple to use.
